# UsernamesAndPasswords
Implements a hash function to store usernames and passwords into a bucket array
## General Information
This project implements a hash function to store usernames and passwords into a bucket array,
which will be initialized by loading username/password sets from a file called password.txt. A polynomial
hash function stores the username in order to determine which bucket the username/password combination is
in. Collsions are handled by seperate chaining. Once all username/passwords are loaded from the file, a
printout of the buckets are shown and the program prompts for a username and password combination, which
checks the combination is corrects. The user than has the option to continue or exit the program.
